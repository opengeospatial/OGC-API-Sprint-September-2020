About the Code Sprint
----------------

The Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC) invites interested developers to the September 2020 OGC API Sprint, to be held through remote participation/web-conferencing from September 29th to 30th, 2020.

The code sprint will cover the draft [OGC API - Features - Part 4: Simple Transactions](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-002.html) specification which is an extension of the [OGC API - Features - Part 1: Core](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/is/17-069r3/17-069r3.html) standard. The draft [OGC API - Features - Part 4: Simple Transactions](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-002.html) specification presents an extension that defines the behaviour of a server that supports simple transactions. Simple transactions are transactions that add, replace, modify or delete individual resources from a single collection.

The code sprint will also cover the draft [OGC API - Common - Part 2: Geospatial Data](http://docs.opengeospatial.org/DRAFTS/20-024.pdf) specification, previously titled "OGC API - Common - Part 2: Collections". The draft specification provides a common connection between the API landing page and resource-specific details. That connection includes metadata that describes the collections of hosted resources, common parameters for selecting subsets of those collections, and URI templates for identifying the above. This common connection is sufficient to start the client down the path to resource discovery.

In addition to the aforementioned specifications, the sprint will also explore __Security__ considerations for OGC API standards.
